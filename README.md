Personal project developed while studying C# and .NET to improve my backend skills. I am currently immersed in the course "Be Full-Stack with .NET Web API and Angular + EF Core" on the Udemy platform.
In this project, I decided to put into practice my acquired knowledge and develop a CRUD for managing records. I used the Angular framework, along with TypeScript, to create a dynamic and friendly frontend. Also, to streamline the styling process, I used Bootstrap, ensuring fast responsiveness to the project components.
I am very satisfied with the results achieved in this project and excited to move forward, continuing my learning and looking for new opportunities to apply my knowledge in future projects.

# Start Project
Enter the AppAngular folder with the terminal and launch npm install in the terminal, after that use npm Start to run the project and for the front to make http calls, enter the CrudApi folder with the terminal and run Dotnet watch run on the console.

Remembering that I'm using Angular 10 and .Net3.
